# AI Travel Agent ✈️🤖

## 📌 About This Project

AI Travel Agent is a project I built as part of the **Scrimba AI Engineer Certification**. My goal was to take the core assignment further and demonstrate how AI and real-time APIs can be combined into a practical, user-friendly travel planning app.

This project highlights my skills in:

- **AI integration** → leveraging OpenAI to generate natural, conversational trip recommendations
- **Problem-solving** → designing an end-to-end travel planning workflow from scratch
- **Technical implementation** → connecting multiple APIs, handling dynamic data, and deploying with Cloudflare
- **User experience & design** → building a clean, functional interface with Figma and SCSS modules

It’s a demonstration of how I approach building **scalable, AI-powered solutions** with modern web technologies.

## 🔗 Demo

- [Live Demo: AI Travel Agent](https://ai-travel-agent-6es.pages.dev/)
- [Cloudflare Worker Repop](https://github.com/ajkendal/ai-travel-agent-worker)

## 🧳 What It Does

The app collects key trip details — **number of travelers, departure and destination, travel dates, and budget** — and returns:

- Real-time **weather forecasts**
- **Flight options** with AI-generated descriptions
- **Hotel recommendations** with short personalized insights
